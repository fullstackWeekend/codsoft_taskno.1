## Task at Hand
### Project 1: First Week Internship Journey
In my first week at CodSoft, I embarked on a journey into the world of UI/UX. I began by mapping out task flows, understanding the significance of user journeys, and delving into design tools like Figma and Adobe to create wireframes for a mobile app. The ultimate thrill was seeing my ideas come to life on the screen. I immersed myself in learning UI/UX, experimented with design tools, and discovered the magic of wireframes and user flows. Understanding and translating the client's vision became a key aspect of this role.
